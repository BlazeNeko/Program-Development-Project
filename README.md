# Program-Development-Project

This project consists in the generation of a Maze with some characters of the well known Game of Thrones Series.
They must reach the iron throne while gathering keys through the maze. 
White Walkers can kill other characters. 
The characters movement is simulated through different algorithms


The project was made by 2 students:
  -Ignacio Caro Cumplido (BrioMc)
  -Javier Ballesteros Mor√≥n (BlazeNeko)
